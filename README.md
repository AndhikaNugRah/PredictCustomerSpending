Correlation Analysis and Prediction Model for Shopping Habits

Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze the correlation between the time spent by customers in a shop and the amount they spend. 

The project also includes a simple user interface that allows users to input their shopping time and receive an estimate of the amount they may spend.

Overview:

This project uses Python with popular libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to develop a predictive model for estimating the amount spent by customers based on the time they spend in a shop. 

The model is trained using random data generated for 100 customer shopping habits and then used to make predictions for new input values.

Key Features:

Correlation analysis between time spent and amount spent

User interface that allows users to input their shopping time and receive an estimate of the amount they may spend

Simple text-based user interface with recursive calls to allow users to continue making predictions

Technical Requirements:

Python programming language

NumPy library for numerical computations

Matplotlib library for data visualization

Scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks, including polynomial regression

No external dataset is required as random data is generated for this project.

Design:

The project's design is focused on developing a simple yet effective predictive model using polynomial regression. 

The user interface is text-based and allows users to input their shopping time and receive an estimate of the amount they may spend.
